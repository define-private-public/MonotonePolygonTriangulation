X-Monotone Polygon Triangulation (in Dart)
==========================================

Back in my fourth year of college, I was taking a course in Computational
Geometry.  As an final project for the course, I chose to do create an
interactive polygon triangulation demo (for X-Monotone polygons only).

The project is done with Dart, though using `dart2js` you can compile it to
JavaScript.
